# Shopping Cart Web App

This is a shopping cart web application built using TypeScript, React.js, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Browse products
- Add products to cart
- Remove products from cart
- Adjust product quantities in cart
- Calculate total price
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to the language, which helps catch type errors early in the development process.

- **React.js**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of the application efficiently.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs. It provides a set of pre-designed utility classes that can be used to style elements without writing custom CSS.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/HassanAbdirahin/Shopping-Cart

2. **Install dependencies:**
